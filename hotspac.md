Curious if all-female team is a lightning rod for attention, interviews and promo. Jumping on warrants.                                        |                                                | GMBT   | #N/A        | YET TO SPAC - WANT IN

Will sell the LOI/DA pop. Likely buyback if the momentum is there. But losing patience... WHERE IS MY LOI!!!                                   | $12.00                                         | THCA   | $10.82      | ðŸ”¥ HOLDING

LiDAR cooled with the rest of the SPAC's more than I thought. Still watching close.                                                            | $15.00                                         | CLA    | $13.27      | ðŸ”¥WATCHING

Bullish big time. I like GIK next to NGA as the next EV boomers.                                                                               | $14.00                                         | GIK    | $13.72      | ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥HOLDING
